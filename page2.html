        <p>Let's make a simple strawberry banana smoothie as a base. You could make this smoothie or replace the
                ingredients based on the suggestion on the Smoothie Lab page.</p>

            <p>First, let's add the fruits. In this case, only bananas and strawberries, both frozen. Potential other
                ingredients can include blueberries, mango, pineapple, kiwi, or any other fruit of your choosing. There
                are no vegetables in this particular smoothie, but you can add leafy greens such as kale or spinach to
                increase fiber content. In this smoothie, I added 1 cup of fruit.</p>

            <p>Next is the liquid. I added 1/2 cup of milk. You can also use water, any other type of milk, or juice as
                your liquid base. You can add more or less liquid depending on how thick you want your smoothie. Finally,
                the thickener. I used only a spoonful of peanut butter. Potential replacements include yogurt, honey, or
                syrup. Now we have all the ingredients. Additional ingredients you can add include protein powder,
                graham crackers, oats, pumpkin spice, turmeric, or any other spice that you think will enhance the
                smoothie.</p>

            <p>Here's the most important step: blending your ingredients. For this demonstration, I'm using an immersion
                blender, but a regular blender will work just as well. Just be sure to blend with the lid on. When
                blending your smoothie, blend on the highest power option available. The longer it blends, the more
                liquid it becomes. Blend until fully pureed and there are no solids in the smoothie. Pour it into a cup
                and enjoy the smoothie you created.</p>

    <p>Remember, this isn't the only smoothie you can make. You can create your own depending on the ingredients you
        decide to use. Remember to experiment and happy smoothie making!</p>
