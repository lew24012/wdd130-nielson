        <p>Let's make a simple strawberry banana smoothie as a base. You could make this smoothie or replace the ingredients based on the suggestion on the Smoothie Lab page.</p>
        <p>First let's add the fruits. In this case, are only bananas and strawberries, both frozen. Potential other ingredients can include blueberries, mango, pineapple, kiwi, or any other fruit of your choosing. There are no vegetables in this particular smoothie, but you can any leafy green such as kale or spinach to add some fiber content. In this smoothie, I added 1 cup of fruit.</p>

        <p>Next is the liquid. I added 1/2 cup of milk. You can also use water, any other type of milk, or juice as your liquid base. You can add more or less liquid depending on how thick you want your smoothie. Finally the thickener. I used only a spoonful of peanut butter. Potential replacements include yogurt, honey, or syrup. Now we have all the ingredients. Additional ingredients you can add include protein powder, graham crackers, oats, pumpkin spice, turmeric, or any other spice that you think will enhance the smoothie.</p>

        <p>Here's the most important step: blending your ingredients. For this demonstration, I'm using an immersion blender, but a regular blender will be applicable for this instruction. Just be sure to blend with the lid on. When blending your smoothie, blend on the highest power option there is. The longer it blends, the more liquid it becomes. Blend until fully pureed and there are no solids in the smoothie. You pour it into a cup and enjoy the smoothie you created.</p>

    <section>Remember this isn't the only smoothie you can make, you can create your own depending on the ingredients you decide to put it. Remember to experiment and happy smoothie making.</section>
