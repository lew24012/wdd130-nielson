      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Start by finding the right tools and proportions for creating a smoothie.</b> When creating our smoothies, we use a blender and not a food processor. A food processor will chop and slice ingredients more efficiently but a blender will liquify them, creating our smoothie consistency. There are 2 types of blenders, a regular blender and an immersion blender. A regular blender is the typical household appliance most are familiar with, putting ingredients in a container connected to a machine and blending when powered on. An immersion blender is a handheld device that blends ingredients in a separate container. Both tools work with smoothies but be sure to have a large enough container to blend your ingredients if you are using an immersion blender.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The next important concept to remember is smoothie proportions.</b> The ideal smoothie is 2 parts fruit/vegetable, 1 part liquid, and half part thickener. This is how you get the texture of a smoothie most are familiar with. If you like your smoothie thicker, you can add more thickener, and more liquid if you like it thinner. It depends on what you prefer in a smoothie. Adding fruits and vegetables to your smoothies is based on your preferences in taste. This is where most of the flavor comes in and you'll have lots of freedom to choose what flavor you want in your smoothie. Flavor also doesn't strictly come from fruits and vegetables, you can also add nuts, honey, spices, and other ingredients you think will enhance the flavor of your smoothie. To re-iterate, the flavor of your smoothie is based on what you put into it. It also determine the nutritional value of your smoothie based on the fruits and vegetables you add . 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are some potential ingredients</b> you can put in your smoothies. For the liquid componet, any popular beverage for consumption can be used. Some examples include but not limited to: water, milk, juice, almond milk, coconut milk, and almond milk. Any cold beverage would work. Your choice of liquid depends on your tastes.  For your thickener, it's important to choose flavors that are not overwheleming that envelop the flavor of the smoothie. Some potential choices of thickener include, peanut butter, greek yogurt, honey, or syrup. Basically anything ingredient that can create a thick consistency. Remember not to add too much. Ice can also be a good thickener too. Finally the fruits and vegetables. You can add all fruits, all veggies, or a mix of both. If you are working with fruits, it's best to blend them frozen instead of fresh. This is because it's tougher to puree them when fresh and the water content in fruits expands when frozen. Frozen fruits will give you more liquid consistency. Additionally you can add other ingredients such as crackers, chocolate, spices, and other food to flavor your smoothie. Your only limit is your imagination, and if it's edible. Try mix and matching different combanations of smoothies to figure out what tastes best for you,

        <b>Let's make a simple strawberry banana smoothie as a base. </b>You could make this smoothie or replace the ingredients based on the suggestion on the Smoothie Lab page. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>First let's add the fruits.</b> In this case, are only bananas and strawberries, both frozen. Potential other ingredients can include blueberries, mango, pineapple, kiwi, or any other fruit of your choosing. There are no vegetables in this particular smoothie, but you can any leafy green such as kale or spinach to add some fiber content. In this smoothie, I added 1 cup of fruit. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Next is the liquid. </b> I added 1/2 cup of milk. You can also use water, any other type of milk, or juice as your liquid base. You can add more or less liquid depending on how thick you want your smoothie. Finally the thickener. I used only a spoonful of peanut butter. Potential replacements include yogurt, honey, or syrup. Now we have all the ingredients. Additional ingredients you can add include protein powder, graham crackers, oats, pumpkin spice, turmeric, or any other spice that you think will enhance the smoothie.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b> Here's the most important step: blending your ingredients.</b> For this demonstration, I'm using an immersion blender, but a regular blender will be applicable for this instruction. Just be sure to blend with the lid on. When blending your smoothie, blend on the highest power option there is. The longer it blends, the more liquid it becomes. Blend until fully pureed and there are no solids in the smoothie. You pour it into a cup and enjoy the smoothie you created.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Remember this isn't the only smoothie you can make, you can create your own depending on the ingredients you decide to put it.</b> Remember to experiment and happy smoothie making.
